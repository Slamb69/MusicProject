## Quirify is a musician's comprehensive music library and concert planning web application. 

### Search for Music
Entering a composer's name, a piece's title, or key word, the user will receive a list of pieces. Clicking on a piece provides its meta data, including texts and translations, along with a list of any available sheet music versions. Clicking on a sheet music version reveals any audio files associated with the particular version. Pieces, sheet music and audio files can be added to a user's library.


### My Library
Targeted for choir directors, Quirify's "My Library" feature stores data about pieces owned or of interest, along with associated sheet music editions and audio files (e.g. midi). 

### Concert Planning and Management
Under construction. 

When completed, Quirify will allow users to build concert setlists, with the flexibility to extend the list to multiple performances, and to make specific assignments for each piece's parts, specific to each event. Assignments can then be viewed by performer, part (insrument), or group and specific sheet music and practice files can be pulled for that subset.
