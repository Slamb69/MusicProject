Quirify is a musician's comprehensive music library and concert planning web application. 

###The Search Feature
Entering a composer's name, a piece's title, or key word, the user will receive a list of public domain pieces. Clicking on the piece provides its meta data, along with a list of any available sheet music versions. Clicking on a sheet music version reveals any audio files associated with the particular version. Pieces, sheet music and audio files can be added to a library.


### My Library
Targeted for choir directors, Quirify's "My Library" feature stores data about pieces owned or of interest, along with associated sheet music editions and audio files (e.g. midi).

A convenient summary of "projects" included on the library page.
